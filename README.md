## Azure AS Example

This project is an Azure based example LoRaWAN Application Server. This example Application Server was developed to use the LoRa Edge(TM) Tracker Reference Design as an end device but can easily be modified to support other devices. The project provides an easy to follow example of the interaction required by an Application Server with the LoRa Cloud(TM) Services to support functions such as Geolocation Solver (GNSS/Wi-Fi), Advanced Transport Services, Almanac update over-the-air, and others.
